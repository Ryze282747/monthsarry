                    <span>
                        &emsp; Happy first month! I'm so sorry I couldn't give you a gift, but I hope this message shows you how much I cherish you. There was no other way, my baby. Thank you for this incredible month. Can you believe we met in ML, of all places? We started chatting, playing together, and our connection grew stronger and stronger until you asked for my Instagram. It's like fate, finding my soulmate in the vast world of ML, and even better, you're so close!

                    <span>
                        &emsp; Thank you for being my constant, my rock, my everything. You love me so deeply, and it means the world to me. I never thought I'd love again, but you changed everything. I swore off love, but meeting you made me realize I was ready to risk it all for you. You're my forever, my one and only, and I'd give you anything â€“ my heart, my soul, my life.

                        &emsp; I'm so sorry for any mistakes I've made this past month. I've stumbled, and I'm truly sorry. But I promise to be better, my sweet baby. I'll never repeat those mistakes. Please, just stay with me. The thought of losing you terrifies me. You know that, right? Please don't leave me; don't let me repeat the hurts you've experienced. I promise I'll never hurt you like that.

                    <span>
                        &emsp; I'm sorry if I've ever hurt you. But remember our motto, baby? Fight, fix, stay. Let's always stick to that, okay? I'm always here for you, your biggest supporter, your safe haven. I'll never leave you, my baby. Never. Even if you push me away a million times, I'll always come back because my love for you is unbreakable. You're my weakness, my everything, and I'll always be here.

                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; My sweet baby, don't overthink things. Remember, you're the only one. My love for you is eternal, unchanging, no matter what. I'd never do anything to jeopardize us, my baby, because you are my world. You're perfect, exactly as you are. No one else compares. You're my everything.

                        &emsp; About your habits, my precious baby. Please, try not to overeat. Take care of your beautiful body. We need you healthy to build our future together! Get enough sleep, eat well, and stay hydrated, especially now that it's so hot. Let's work together to minimize those bad habits. It's not about control; it's about my deep love and concern for you. I love you so much, and I don't want you to get sick. It's okay to get sick sometimes, but let's try to keep it to a minimum.

                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; And about our disagreements, my baby, please don't ever tire of me. Let's always choose understanding and compassion. Breakups and time-outs aren't the answer. I don't want our love to fade. Let's communicate better and always work through our problems together. It's normal to have disagreements, so let's not worry. I'll never get tired of understanding and loving you, my baby. I'm always here; I'll never leave you.

                    <span>
                        &emsp; I'm sorry for the times I've been overwhelmed, to the point where I've considered giving up, but losing you is unbearable. Please, baby, never agree to that. Don't ever leave me because you're everything to me. Please, my baby, don't ever think I've stopped loving you. My love for you surpasses my love for myself. The sight of you hurting, crying, or struggling breaks my heart. You're my weakness, and your pain is my pain. Please, don't leave me. Let's find comfort in each other, my baby. I'll be here to comfort you too. I'm sorry for my imperfections, but I'm working on being better every day. I hope you never seek my shortcomings in someone else. I hope you never tire of understanding and loving me. I promise I'll never leave you, never abandon you, and my love for you will never change.

                        &emsp; Remember my requests, my baby. Please remember everything and try your best. Remember, I love you more than words can say, so much that the thought of losing you is unbearable. Thank you again for this amazing month. I know it's not always easy, but together we'll face anything. Thank you, my baby. Please stay with me because I can't imagine life without you. If we have a problem, let's fix it together. Breakups and time-outs aren't the answer. I'll always understand you, and my love for you will never waver. Happy first month, my baby! I hope you felt my love in this message. I love you more than anything! I'll never leave you. Mwa!
